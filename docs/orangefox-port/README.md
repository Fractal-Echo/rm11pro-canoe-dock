# OrangeFox Port Notes

This folder tracks the RM10 Pro OrangeFox recovery port work that was adapted for the REDMAGIC 11 Pro / NX809J.

Source roles:

- `/home/richtofen/android/repositories/rm11pro-canoe-dock/ports/orangefox-recovery/device_nubia_NX809J`: current local fork path for the RM10 Pro to RM11 Pro OrangeFox device-tree port.
- `/home/richtofen/android/repositories/Main Assets/OrangeFox_sync`: small OrangeFox sync helper and fox_14.1 patch set copied into `scripts/orangefox-sync`.
- `/home/richtofen/android/repositories/Main Assets/fox_14.1`: full OrangeFox/TWRP source tree. Generated `out/` artifacts were deleted during cleanup and must be rebuilt when needed. This is not copied into Git.
- `/home/richtofen/android/repositories/Main Assets/recovery-forensics`: local raw recovery images, logs, headers, and AVB comparisons. Raw payloads stay local; summary docs live here.
- `ports/orangefox-recovery/`: curated dock snapshot of the RM11 OrangeFox device-tree source/config/docs from the current fork.

Current status:

```

High-confidence facts:

- OrangeFox for NX809J built successfully from the fox_14.1 tree.
- `fastboot boot` failed with `Bad Buffer Size`.
- `fastboot flash recovery_a` accepted the first image.
- The phone routed to fastboot instead of OrangeFox recovery.
- Stock `recovery_a` rollback restored Android boot.
- Stock and OrangeFox images are both Android boot image header v4 ramdisk-only recovery images.
- The failed OrangeFox image differed from stock in AVB metadata: stock used `SHA256_RSA4096` and rollback index `1`; failed OrangeFox used algorithm `NONE` and rollback index `0`.
- AVBTEST1 rebuild restores `SHA256_RSA4096` and rollback index `1` with a generated validation key, not the OEM key.

Safety rules:

- Do not publish OrangeFox as usable yet.
- Do not retest the original failed image.
- Keep stock `recovery_a` rollback ready before any device-side recovery test.
- Treat AVBTEST1 as the next cautious test only after the expected rollback path is confirmed.
