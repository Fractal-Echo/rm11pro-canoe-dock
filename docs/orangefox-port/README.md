# OrangeFox Port Notes

This folder tracks the RM10 Pro OrangeFox recovery port work that was adapted for the REDMAGIC 11 Pro / NX809J.

Source roles:

- `<repo-root>/recovery/device/zte/sm88XX`: current local fork path for the RM10 Pro to RM11 Pro OrangeFox device-tree port.
- `<local-build-root>/OrangeFox_sync`: small OrangeFox sync helper copied into `scripts/orangefox-sync`, with dock-owned fox_14.1 patches under `recovery/patches/fox_14.1`.
- `<orangefox-tree>`: full OrangeFox/TWRP source tree. Generated `out/` artifacts were deleted during cleanup and must be rebuilt when needed. This is not copied into Git.
- `<local-build-root>/recovery-forensics`: local raw recovery images, logs, headers, and AVB comparisons. Raw payloads stay local; summary docs live here.
- `recovery/`: curated dock snapshot of the RM11 OrangeFox device-tree source/config/docs from the current fork.
- `scripts/local-build/`: local-only OrangeFox build lane for fork owners and private workstations.

High-confidence facts:

- OrangeFox for NX809J built successfully from the fox_14.1 tree.
- `fastboot boot` failed with `Bad Buffer Size`.
- Standard `fastboot boot` is not a useful recovery test path for this layout.
- The 2026-06-09 rooted-Android `dd` test to `recovery_a` reached the RedMagic logo and did not reach OrangeFox UI/ADB.
- Stock `recovery_a` rollback restored Android boot.
- Stock and OrangeFox images are both Android boot image header v4 ramdisk-only recovery images.
- The failed OrangeFox image differed from stock in AVB metadata: stock used `SHA256_RSA4096` and rollback index `1`; failed OrangeFox used algorithm `NONE` and rollback index `0`.
- AVBTEST1 rebuild restores `SHA256_RSA4096` and rollback index `1` with a generated validation key, not the OEM key.
- The current local candidate additionally replaces the vendor_boot-derived recovery fstab and aggressive qcom recovery init with stock-derived/minimal versions.
- A separate Coding-BR sm88XX-in-Fox build target builds locally with
  `TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM=sm8850`, `PRODUCT_PLATFORM=canoe`, and
  `TARGET_CPU_VARIANT_RUNTIME=oryon`.
- The 2026-06-10 rooted-Android `dd` test of the Coding-BR sm88XX-in-Fox image to
  `recovery_a` booted past the RedMagic logo, showed OrangeFox splash, and brought
  up root recovery ADB.
- The Coding-BR sm88XX-in-Fox test did not prove full UI, touch, decrypt, MTP,
  flashing, USB OTG, or reboot UI behavior.
- Logs from the splash/ADB test point first at Android 16 decrypt/security runtime
  incompatibility under the Fox 14 userspace, not at DRM graphics as the primary
  blocker.
- Candidate D1 disabled the decrypt/runtime lane and reached full OrangeFox UI
  plus root recovery ADB. D1 was a UI-isolation pass, not a decrypt pass.
- Candidate D1T and D1T2 did not improve touch. Recovery still jumped between
  search/keyboard/screens and buttons did not register reliably.
- Candidate D1T3 added Coding-BR/TWRP's NX809J minuitwrp touch normalization on
  top of D1T2. On 2026-06-11 it booted to OrangeFox, exposed root recovery ADB,
  disabled screen timeout, and allowed basic navigation through Backup, Menu,
  and Wipe views. Treat this as a basic UI/touch navigation pass only.
- D1T3 still does not prove decrypt, MTP, fastbootd, partition operations,
  backups, wipes, installs, USB OTG, or reboot-menu behavior.
- D2E booted with recovery ADB, but crypto was disabled
  (`ro.orangefox.crypto_enabled=0`) and service-start probing did not solve
  decrypt.
- D2F enabled crypto and reached the OrangeFox animation with recovery ADB, but
  did not reach the menu. Logs pointed at decrypt/security service restart
  loops.
- D2G is a preflash-only candidate. Its frozen artifact is exactly
  `104857600` bytes with SHA-256
  `a806ffcc82eeec0ffd29d2c07f5f8e6c9a8669fce783ce3901e4f6711baa9664`.
  The built recovery root now proves the D2G marker and all manual
  `sys.rm11.d2g.*` triggers landed.
- D2M proved the auto-decrypt lane: OrangeFox booted, crypto was enabled,
  `/data` and `/sdcard` mounted decrypted, and the UI became usable after
  applying the live lock/timeout settings.
- D2N is the current recovery baseline. It preserves D2M decrypt behavior,
  auto-starts gatekeeper after `vendor.sys.listeners.registered=true`, applies
  durable UI lock/timeout defaults, and has human-confirmed tap, scroll, and
  navigation. Its frozen image is exactly `104857600` bytes with SHA-256
  `a9c70ce885b025fc4b1618798b99bdc05b45239fa76c880415198ab26d9a5fd0`.

Safety rules:

- Treat D2N as the current usable recovery baseline for the lab, with remaining
  operations still requiring targeted validation.
- Do not retest the original failed image or pre-stock-fstab AVBTEST1 image.
- Keep stock `recovery_a` rollback ready before any device-side recovery test.
- Test only one recovery slot first.
- Treat the stock-fstab/minimal-init build as the next candidate only after the expected rollback path is confirmed.
- Keep D1T3 in the no-decrypt lane until the Android 16 keymint/gatekeeper/qsee
  runtime issue is handled separately.
- Keep D2N on one-slot recovery validation until MTP, fastbootd, backup,
  restore, install, wipe, USB OTG, reboot-menu, and cross-slot workflows are
  tested.
- Keep Wi-Fi as a separate future lane.
