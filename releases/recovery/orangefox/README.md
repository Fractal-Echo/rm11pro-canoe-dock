# OrangeFox Recovery Releases

Current public prebuilt:

- [D2N baseline](d2n-baseline/README.md)

The generated GitHub Actions prerelease `orangefox-nx809j-latest` is currently
build-only evidence. Its 2026-06-17 device-side test stalled on the REDMAGIC
logo after flashing `recovery_b`; it needs correction before it is treated as a
usable recovery artifact.

D2N is the current RM11 Pro / REDMAGIC 11 Pro / NX809J recovery baseline. It
booted to OrangeFox UI in the recovery lane and preserved the D1T3 touch/UI
baseline. Treat it as the current baseline/release candidate, not a universal
stable guarantee.

```

The raw `recovery.img` is not committed separately because it is exactly
`104857600` bytes. The committed OrangeFox zip contains that image as
`recovery.img`.

Historical failed/probe candidates remain documented in:

- [Build Result](BUILD-RESULT.md)
- [Forensics](FORENSICS.md)
- [Rollback](ROLLBACK.md)

Only test recovery with one recovery slot and stock rollback ready.
