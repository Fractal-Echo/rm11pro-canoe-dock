# OrangeFox Recovery - REDMAGIC 11 Pro (NX809J)

> RM11 Pro / NX809J OrangeFox recovery port. The upstream ancestry is the REDMAGIC 10 Pro tree; active-device labels in this fork should stay RM11 Pro / NX809J.

## Current Status

This branch is an NX809J port with stock image evidence and live Android ADB evidence applied. It builds successfully. The latest confirmed device-side test wrote only `recovery_a` from rooted Android, reached the RedMagic logo, and did not reach OrangeFox UI or recovery ADB. Stock `recovery_a` rollback succeeded and Android boot was restored.

The current local candidate keeps the recovery AVB signing metadata and also replaces the vendor_boot-derived fstab/init surfaces with stock-derived recovery fstab and stock-minimal qcom init. It has not been device-tested after that rebuild.

| Feature | Status |

## Port Evidence Used

- Stock `recovery.img` and `vendor_boot.img` contain NX809J Android 16 fingerprints.
- Stock `prop.default` reports `ro.board.platform=canoe`, `ro.product.first_api_level=36`, and `ro.board.api_level=202504`.
- Stock `vendor_boot` DTB reports Qualcomm `alor` base with `canoe` compatibles and Adreno 840 strings.
- Live Android ADB baseline is recorded in [`docs/rm11-live-adb-baseline.md`](docs/rm11-live-adb-baseline.md).
- Stock rawprogram XML reports:
  - `boot`: 100663296 bytes
  - `vendor_boot`: 100663296 bytes
  - `recovery`: 104857600 bytes
  - `dtbo`: 75497472 bytes
  - `init_boot`: 8388608 bytes
  - `super`: 19327352832 bytes
- Stock `fstab.qcom` reports EROFS logical partitions and Android 16 metadata encryption flags.
- Live Android reports `panel0-backlight` max brightness `8190`, `synaptics_tcm_touch`, `goodix_fp`, `nubia_tgk_aw_sar*`, and `canoe-mtp-wsa884x-snd-card` jack input names.
- Live Android confirms the recovery-focused vendor module names currently listed in `TW_LOAD_VENDOR_MODULES` exist under `/vendor_dlkm/lib/modules`.
- Live Android 16 DTBO and crypto/qsee prebuilts are staged under `prebuilt/android16/`.
- Post-KernelSU live Android state is recorded in [`docs/rm11-post-ksun-adb-sanity.md`](docs/rm11-post-ksun-adb-sanity.md); it confirms the current Android-side root context is KernelSU (`u:r:ksu:s0`), not Magisk.
- OrangeFox build evidence is recorded in [`docs/rm11-orangefox-build-pass-2026-06-07.md`](docs/rm11-orangefox-build-pass-2026-06-07.md).
- OrangeFox failed boot and rollback evidence is recorded in [`docs/rm11-orangefox-flash-pass-boot-fail-rollback-pass-2026-06-07.md`](docs/rm11-orangefox-flash-pass-boot-fail-rollback-pass-2026-06-07.md).
- Recovery image/header forensics are recorded in [`docs/rm11-orangefox-image-format-forensics-2026-06-07.md`](docs/rm11-orangefox-image-format-forensics-2026-06-07.md). Stock and OrangeFox are both Android boot image header v4 ramdisk-only recovery images, but stock has a signed `SHA256_RSA4096` recovery AVB footer and the failed OrangeFox image has `Algorithm: NONE`.
- AVBTEST1 comparison evidence is recorded in [`docs/rm11-orangefox-avbtest1-image-format-comparison-2026-06-07.md`](docs/rm11-orangefox-avbtest1-image-format-comparison-2026-06-07.md). AVBTEST1 fixed the hard footer mismatch: `SHA256_RSA4096`, rollback index `1`, rollback location `0`, and auth block present.
- The 2026-06-09 logo-hang evidence is recorded in [`docs/rm11-orangefox-recovery-a-logo-hang-2026-06-09.md`](docs/rm11-orangefox-recovery-a-logo-hang-2026-06-09.md).

## Important Unknowns

- Decryption is not solved yet. Android 16 system keystore, vendor onekeymint, gatekeeper, qsee, and related libraries are wired from `prebuilt/android16/`, but recovery-side FBE has not been boot-tested.
- Vendor blobs and HAL services are still inherited from the RM10 tree unless explicitly replaced in `device.mk`.
- The experimental NX809J kernel work is useful context, but this tree currently uses stock RM11 prebuilts as the baseline.
- Recovery boot failed on the first rooted-Android `recovery_a` test image. Live Android properties, by-name links, input device names, loaded modules, and basic sysfs paths have been captured.
- The local OrangeFox source tree now exists at `<orangefox-tree>`; build validation passed again after the stock-fstab/minimal-init patch.
- Do not publish or retest the original failed OrangeFox image. The next eligible device-side test is the stock-fstab/minimal-init image only, and only as a cautious controlled one-slot test with stock `recovery_a` rollback ready.

## Building

### Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 / 24.04
- At least 16GB RAM
- At least 150GB free disk space
- OpenJDK 11

### Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
  git curl wget python3 python-is-python3 \
  bc bison build-essential ccache flex \
  g++-multilib gcc-multilib gnupg gperf \
  imagemagick lib32ncurses-dev lib32readline-dev \
  lib32z1-dev lz4 libncurses-dev libsdl1.2-dev \
  libssl-dev libwxgtk3.2-dev libxml2-dev \
  libxml2-utils lzop pngcrush rsync schedtool \
  squashfs-tools xsltproc zip zlib1g-dev openjdk-11-jdk
```

### Sync OrangeFox source

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/OrangeFox/sync.git ~/OrangeFox_sync
cd ~/OrangeFox_sync
./orangefox_sync.sh --branch 14.1 --path ~/fox_14.1
```

### Place device tree

```bash
mkdir -p ~/fox_14.1/device/zte
git clone https://github.com/Fractal-Echo/rm11pro-canoe-dock ~/rm11pro-canoe-dock
# Do not use --delete here; the local tree also holds untracked prebuilts and AVB test keys.
rsync -a ~/rm11pro-canoe-dock/recovery/device/zte/sm88XX/ ~/fox_14.1/device/zte/sm88XX/
```

The maintained dock helper for this step is:

```bash
~/rm11pro-canoe-dock/scripts/local-build/build-orangefox-nx809j-local.sh --env ~/rm11pro-canoe-dock/scripts/local-build/env-orangefox-nx809j.local --skip-build
```

### Build

```bash
cd ~/fox_14.1
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch orangefox_NX809J-ap2a-eng
mka adbd recoveryimage
```

Output should be at:

```text
out/target/product/NX809J/recovery.img
```

## Device-Side Testing

Do not test with `fastboot boot`. The recovery output is a ramdisk-only recovery partition image sized to `recovery_a`, not a direct ramboot image.

Do not flash the original failed OrangeFox image again. Keep stock `recovery_a` and `recovery_b` backups available before any test.

For a first retest, write only the active recovery slot from Android with root:

```bash
adb push recovery.img /sdcard/recovery.img
adb shell su -c "dd if=/sdcard/recovery.img of=/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/recovery_a bs=4M status=progress"
adb shell su -c "sync"
adb reboot recovery
```

Do not write `recovery_b` until UI, ADB, touch, MTP, decryption expectations,
and reboot-to-system have been checked.
